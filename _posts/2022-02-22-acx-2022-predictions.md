From Scott Alexander's[^1] post [Predictions For 2022][2022 ACX predictions], on [Astral Codex Ten][ACX]:

> Sam Marks and Eric Neyman have kindly turned this tradition into a contest.
>
If you want, you can go to their [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QLfg4WgmOobgcw-I1eHLi8U6yxivggHH5G__3TQ4sug/closedform) and predict the same set of questions I did (minus the personal and redacted ones). Use the same rules I did: no peeking at the prediction markets, and no more than five minutes of research per question. If you don’t know anything about a question, you can leave it blank and it will get filled with my prediction by default.
>
The winner will get eternal glory (realistically: mentioned on an Open Thread) and a free ACX subscription.
>

## Page Epistemics

___Status___

"Draft": The prediction table is the primary content of this post, but there are many other pieces missing, as the information necessary for an analysis is not yet known.

___Certainty___

"N/A": There is no central claim made in this post, so I am not attributing a certainty at the moment. I could, once the resolution values for the questions become known, calibrate myself and assign a certainty value using this.

___Importance___
