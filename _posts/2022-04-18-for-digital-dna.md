__Takeaways__:

__General Transparency__:

__Acknowledgements__:

__Overview__: I first discuss, very briefly, biological information storage, and then move on to discussing some properties of DNA. Next, I look at how much digital data there is on Earth, and how people store this data. I illustrate some present and upcoming issues with the current paradigms for data and data storage. Finally, I look at DNA digital data storage, introducing properties of DNA that make it a good candidate for storing data.

[wiki_E_age]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth"

[^Eage]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Dalrymple, G. Brent. "The age of the Earth in the twentieth century: a problem (mostly) solved." Geological Society, London, Special Publications 190, no. 1 (2001): 205-221. See <https://creationismonline.com/YEC/Dalrymple_B.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "...the first calculation by Patterson in 1953 of a valid age for the Earth of 4.55Ga, using the primordial meteoritic lead composition and samples representing the composition of modern Earth lead. The value for the age of the Earth in wide use today was determined by Tera in 1980, who found a value of 4.54 Ga from a clever analysis of the lead isotopic compositions of four ancient conformable lead deposits. Whether this age represents the age of the Earth's accretion, of core formation, or of the material from which the Earth formed is not yet known, but recent evidence suggests it may approximate the latter."

[^Eage2]: _...roughly 4.54 billion years old_: Manhes, Gérard, Claude J. Allègre, Bernard Dupré, and Bruno Hamelin. "Lead isotope study of basic-ultrabasic layered complexes: Speculations about the age of the earth and primitive mantle characteristics." Earth and Planetary Science Letters 47, no. 3 (1980): 370-382. Quote: (pp.1) "If these two bodies are considered as pieces of a “primitive” closed-system mantle, a4.55 ± 0.01 age of the earth can be calculated from their Pb initial ratios."

[^rnaW]: _this hypothesis is called the RNA World Hypothesis, and posits that RNA preceded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)_: Cech, Thomas R. "The RNA worlds in context." Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in biology 4, no. 7 (2012): a006742. See <https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/7/a006742.full.pdf>. Quote: (pp.1) "Did an RNA world exist? Some of the most persuasive arguments in favor of an RNA world are as follows. First, RNA is both an informational molecule and a biocata- lyst—both genotype and phenotype—whereas protein has extremely limited ability to transmit information (as with prions). Thus, RNA should be capable of replicating itself, and indeed RNA can perform the sort of chemistry required for RNA replication (Cech 1986). Second, it is more parsimonious to conceive of a single type of molecule replicating itself than to posit that two different molecules (such as a nucleic acid and a protein capable of replicating that nucleic acid) were synthesized by random chemical reactions in the same place at the same time. Third, the ribosome uses RNA catalysis to perform the key activity of protein synthesis in all extant organisms, so it must have done so in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Fourth, other catalytic activities of RNA—activities that RNA would need in an RNA world but that have not been found in contemporary RNAs—are generally already present in large combinatorial libraries of RNA sequences and can be discovered by SELEX. Fifth, RNA clearly preceded DNA, because multiple enzymes are dedicated to the biosynthesis of the ribonucleotide precursors of RNA, whereas deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis is derivative of ribonucleotide synthesis, requiring only two additional enzymatic activities (thymidylate synthase and ribonucleotide reductase.) Finally, a primordial RNA world has the attractive feature of continuity; it could evolve into contemporary biology by the sort of events that are well precedented, whereas it is unclear how a self-replicating system based on completely unrelated chemistry could have been supplanted by RNA."

Hausman, and Robert E. Hausman. The cell: a molecular approach. Vol. 8. Washington, DC, USA:: ASM press, 2007. Quote: (pp.6) "As discussed further in Chapter 4, all present-day cells use DNA as the genetic material and employ the same basic mechanisms for DNA replication and expression of the genetic information. Genes are the functional units of inheritance, corresponding to segments of DNA that encode proteins or RNA molecules. The nucleotide sequence of a gene is copied into RNA by a process called transcription. For RNAs that encode proteins, their nucleotide sequence is then used to specify the order of amino acids in a protein by a process called translation."

For those currently unaware, radiometric dating research places the [age of the Earth][wiki_E_age] at roughly 4.54 billion years old[^Eage]<sup>,</sup>[^Eage2], which is approximately equal to 56.75 million non-overlapping 80-year human lives. The first microorganisms appeared between "at least 3770 and possibly 4290 million years..." ago[^early]. While the [history][timeline_of_life], [origins][life_began], and [emergence][abio] of life on Earth are still the focus of major investigation, ribonucleic acid (RNA) is current believed to have been the original auto-self-replicating system utilized by early life to store and replicate genetic material; this hypothesis is called the [RNA World Hypothesis][rna_world], and posits that RNA evolutionarily preceded proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Moreover, the RNA world is believed to have ushed in the [ribonucleoproteins][wiki_RNP] world, which subsequently lead to the evolution of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).[^rnaW] Presently, DNA, the other major nucleic acid, rather than RNA, is the platform for the genetic-material of all cells on Earth today[^cell_book]. 

This brings us to the question of what RNA and DNA actually are, and of how they relate to information in biology. Rather than answer this myself, I default to the writers on Wikipedia (as of 06/09/2022), who have done a much better job at providing a comprehensive definition of RNA and DNA than I could have: 

> __Ribonucleic acid ([RNA][wiki_rna])__ is a [polymeric][wiki_polymer] molecule essential in various biological roles in [coding][wiki_coding], [decoding][wiki_decoding], [regulation][wiki_regulation] and [expression][wiki_expression] of[genes][wiki_genes]. RNA and deoxyribonucleic acid ([DNA][wiki_DNA]) are [nucleic acids][wiki_nucleics]. Along with [lipids][wiki_lipids], [proteins][wiki_proteins], and [carbohydrates][wiki_carbs], nucleic acids constitute one of the four major [macromolecules][wiki_macros] essential for all known forms of [life][wiki_life]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [nucleotides][wiki_nucleos], but unlike DNA, RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA ([mRNA][wiki_mRNA]) to convey genetic information (using the [nitrogenous][wiki_nitro_bases] bases of [guanine][wiki_gua], [uracil][wiki_ura], [adenine][wiki_ade], and [cytosine][wiki_cyto], denoted by the letters G, U, A, and C) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [viruses][wiki_vir] encode their genetic information using an RNA [genome][wiki_geno]. 
> 
> [See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA>]

and 

> __Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)__ is a [polymer][wiki_polymer] composed of two [polynucleotide][wiki_polynu] chains that coil around each other to form a [double helix][wiki_doub] carrying [genetic][wiki_gentc] instructions for the development, functioning, growth and [reproduction][wiki_repo] of all known [organisms][wiki_org] and many [viruses][wiki_vir]. DNA and ribonucleic acid ([RNA][wiki_rna]) are [nucleic acids][wiki_nucleics]. Alongside [proteins][wiki_proteins], [lipids][wiki_lipids] and complex [carbohydrates][wiki_carbs] ([polysaccharides][wiki_polys]), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of [macromolecules][wiki_macro] that are essential for all known forms of [life][wiki_life].

__RNA__ and __DNA__[^wiki_dna_img]

![](/assets/2022/for_digital_dna/images/rna_dna_diff.png)

The [central dogma of molecular biology][wiki_dogma] ensapsulates, from a broad lens, the interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins in living organisms in terms of information transfer and storage. As originally stated by Francis Crick[^dogma]:

> The Central Dogma. This states that once "information" has passed into protein it cannot get out again. In more detail, the transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid, or from nucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein, or from protein to nucleic acid is impossible. Information means here the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in the nucleic acid or of amino acid residues in the protein. 

[wiki_half]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"

[wiki_moa]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa"

RNA is much less structurally stable than DNA[^stability], which means that RNA degrades faster. The [half-life][wiki_half][^half_life] of DNA is much longer than that of RNA. For example, researchers looking a leg bones from [Moa][wiki_moa] found that DNA had a half-life of around 521 years. These bones were between 600 - 8000 years old and were preserved at a temperature of 13.1 degrees Celcius. Interestingly, even with an _"ideal preservation temperature of −5ºC, effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years"_.[^moa] Compare this with the half-life of mouse mRNA: around 7 hours (median), with the mRNA of a vast majority of genes having half-lives > 1 hour.[^mouse] DNA is much more robust a capsule for housing genetic information, and its dominion in this regard in all living cells makes sense.

[^half_life]: Given by the equation $N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$. Here, $t$ denotes time, $N_0$ represents the starting amount of the substance in question, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$ the decay rate of the substance, and $N(t)$ the amount of substance left after time $t$.  

[^stability]: _RNA is much less structurally stable and than DNA_: See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world#Comparison_of_DNA_and_RNA_structure>. Quote: "...the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2'-position of the ribose sugar in RNA (illustration, right). [Source 21] This group makes the molecule less stable because, when not constrained in a double helix, the 2' hydroxyl can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the phosphodiester backbone. The hydroxyl group also forces the ribose into the C3'-endo sugar conformation unlike the C2'-endo conformation of the deoxyribose sugar in DNA. This forces an RNA double helix to change from a B-DNA structure to one more closely resembling A-DNA."

[^mouse]: _Compare this with the half-life of mouse mRNA: around 7 hours_: Sharova, Lioudmila V., Alexei A. Sharov, Timur Nedorezov, Yulan Piao, Nabeebi Shaik, and Minoru SH Ko. "Database for mRNA half-life of 19 977 genes obtained by DNA microarray analysis of pluripotent and differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells." DNA research 16, no. 1 (2009): 45-58. See <https://academic.oup.com/dnaresearch/article/16/1/45/364974?login=true>. Quote: (abstract) "Median estimated half-life was 7.1 h and only <100 genes, including Prdm1, Myc, Gadd45 g, Foxa2, Hes5 and Trib1, showed half-life less than 1 h. In general, mRNA species with short half-life were enriched among genes with regulatory functions (transcription factors), whereas mRNA species with long half-life were enriched among genes related to metabolism and structure (extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton)."

[^moa]: _For example, researchers looking a leg bones from [Moa][wiki_moa] found that DNA had a half-life of around 521 years. These bones were between 600 - 8000 years old and were preserved at a temperature of 13.1 degrees Celcius[^moa]._: Kaplan, M. "DNA has a 521-year half-life [at 13.1 C]: genetic material can’t be recovered from dinosaurs–but it lasts longer than thought." Nature News 10 (2012). See <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2012.11555>. Quotes: (pp.1) "But palaeogeneticists led by Morten Allentoft at the University of Copenhagen and Michael Bunce at Murdoch University in Perth, Australia, examined 158 DNA-containing leg bones belonging to three species of extinct giant birds called moa. The bones, which were between 600 and 8,000 years old, had been recovered from three sites within 5 kilometres of each other, with nearly identical preservation conditions including a temperature of 13.1 ºC. The findings are published today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B1."; "By comparing the specimens' ages and degrees of DNA degradation, the researchers calculated that DNA has a half-life of 521 years. That means that after 521 years, half of the bonds between nucleotides in the backbone of a sample would have broken; after another 521 years half of the remaining bonds would have gone; and so on."; "The team predicts that even in a bone at an ideal preservation temperature of −5 ºC, effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years. The DNA would cease to be readable much earlier — perhaps after roughly 1.5 million years, when the remaining strands would be too short to give meaningful information."

That DNA has such a long half-life is quite extraordinary. Two fairly recent examples showcasing this feat of Nature that pierced the public's attention[^public] are Ötzi the iceman and the report of million year-old mammoth remains. Ötzi the iceman is a mummified human (25-40 year-olds and likely murdered) from the Late Neolithic (Copper Age) who was located on 09/19/1991 in the Tyrolean Öztaler Alps.[^back] Believed to be around 5.2k-5.3k years-old (3359 - 3105 BCE)[^old], Ötzi is one of the older mummies that have been retrieved; that DNA is so structurally sound over time can afford us amazing insight into humanity's and Ötzi's past (e.g., Ötzi's last meal[^meal], or his gut microbiome[^biom]). The million year-old mammoths story refers to 3 mammoth (the oldest fossils being 1.2-1.1Ma) specimens of the Early-Middle Pleistocene from Siberia whose DNA was read by a team of researchers; the sequencing and recovery of DNA from these fossils pushed the limits of what people thought was achievable with DNA sequencing[^million_mam], as the previous oldest example NEED was at least 

While I am not sure how the biological properties of lifeforms and cellular mechanics would be different in worlds where DNA was half, a third, etc... as robust as it is in this world, I am grateful, at least with regard to our understanding of the Earth's natural past, that DNA is the way it is.

Quote: (pp.98) "The discovery in September 1991 of a Late Neolithic man in a glacial field between Austria and Italy offered uniquely preserved archaeological samples [1]. Commonly known as the Iceman (or &i, having been found in the Tyrolean &ztaler Alps), the body is the oldest to be retrieved from an Alpine glacier and is one of the best preserved mummified humans ever discovered. Initially thought to date from the Early Bronze Age, Iceman is in fact unique in that he dates from the Copper Age (Chalcolithic) as verified by chemical analysis of the axe he carried at time of death."

"Million-year-old DNA sheds light on the genomic history of mammoths." Nature 591, no. 7849 (2021): 265-269. See <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03224-9).>. Quote: (abstract; pp. 266 x 2) "Temporal genomic data hold great potential for studying evolutionary processes such as speciation. However, sampling across speciation events would, in many cases, require genomic time series that stretch well back into the Early Pleistocene subepoch. Although theoretical models suggest that DNA should survive on this timescale1, the oldest genomic data recovered so far are from a horse specimen dated to 780–560 thousand years ago. Here we report the recovery of genome-wide data from three mammoth specimens dating to the Early and Middle Pleistocene subepochs, two of which are more than one million years old."; "One of the specimens (which we refer to as ‘Krestovka’ on the basis of its find locality) is morphologically similar to the steppe mammoth (a species that was originally defined from the Middle Pleistocene of Europe (Supplementary Information section 1)), and was collected from Lower Olyorian deposits that have been dated to 1.2–1.1 Ma."; "We found that the DNA recovered from the Early and Middle Pleistocene specimens was considerably more fragmented and had higher levels of cytosine deamination than DNA from permafrost-preserved samples dating to the Late Pleistocene subepoch (Extended Data Figs. 3, 4, Supplementary Information section 4). To circumvent this, we used conservative filters and an iterative approach that was designed to minimize spurious mappings of short reads (Supplementary Information section 5). This approach allowed us to recover complete (over 37× coverage) mitogenomes from all three specimens, and 49 million, 884 million and 3,671 million base pairs of nuclear genomic data for the Krestovka, Adycha and Chukochya specimens, respectively (Supplementary Table 3)."

Now that we've examined biological information storage and, in particular, DNA, let us move on to discussing digital data. 

## Data and Storing It 

Humans have created prodigious quantities of digital data. First and foremost, the Internet comes to my mind when I think about this — I imagine the constant and prodigious flow of emails, tweets, messages, posts, etc... inundating networks globally. My website is starting to run slower due to how many images I am including in my posts. 

In the Western world, people are constantly online, with 85% of US citizens being digitial active daily in 2021, and 31% reporting that they're almost constantly online[^pew]. Further on this point, the number of hours spent online per user of the Internet in the US went from 2.7 hours total in 2008 to 6.3 hours total in 2018[^owid_daily]. 

Between 2000 and 2016, the number of Internet users grew from 413m to 3.4b.[^owid_us] Most people reading this will likely fall into the "active online almost constantly" bin, and perhaps have an inside view of the sheer volumes of data being generated each day.  

The size of the Internet and how much digital data humans have generated overall are quantities of intrigue. In particular, 


How is all this data stored? 

Well, there are at least 600 [hyperscale][wiki_h] data centers in operation, with roughly 40% of these being in the US, and around 314 centers planned to be built in the next several years.[^syn]

Quote: "The Internet has been one of our most transformative and fast-growing technologies. Globally, the number of Internet users increased from only 413 million in 2000 to over 3.4 billion in 2016. The one-billion barrier was crossed in 2005. Every day over the past five years, an average of 640,000 people went online for the first time."

From their "About Us" page: "Founded in 1999, Synergy provides market intelligence and analytics for the networking and telecoms industry. Synergy’s research is used worldwide by industry leading companies, Wall Street firms, and government institutions. We specialize in providing comprehensive quantitative market data that is updated every 90 days.

In addition to standard Excel and PDF deliverables, our custom cloud-based online research tool, Synergy Interactive Analysis (SIA™), enables our customers to dynamically search and manipulate the data, as well as create customized market segmentation and reports tailored to their business needs." Quote: "New data from Synergy Research Group shows that the total number of large data centers operated by hyperscale providers increased to 597 at the end of 2020, having more than doubled since the end of 2015." and "With a current known pipeline of 314 future new hyperscale data centers, the installed base of operational data centers will pass the 1,000 mark in three years’ time and continue growing rapidly thereafter.", respectively.

The conclusion, at least after having learned a little about DNA, is obvious: biological data storage, with DNA as the prime candidate, has extraordinary potential in terms of changing the limits.
