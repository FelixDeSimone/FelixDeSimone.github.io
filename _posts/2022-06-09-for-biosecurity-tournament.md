### Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11274/international-pandemic-treaty-before-2025/>

> The idea of an international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness has been recently discussed. According to a March 2021 joint article by leaders of 23 countries as well as President of the European Council and Director-General of the World Health Organisation, the main goal of such a treaty would be to:
> 
> > _foster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment._
> 
> According to the European Council, the following are the anticipated next steps of the planned treaty:
> 
> > _The intergovernmental negotiating body, tasked with drafting and negotiating this international instrument, will hold its next meeting by 1 August 2022, to discuss progress on a working draft. It will then deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim to adopt the instrument by 2024._
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the potential of this treaty to be adopted.
> 
> ___Will at least 10 countries ratify a new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness before 2025?___
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if, by December 31, 2024, at least 10 countries have ratified an new international treaty on pandemic prevention and preparedness. This question concerns only new treaties, meaning treaties which have not been ratified by any nation as of June 1, 2022.

### Novel Pandemic 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11164/25m-killed-by-pandemic-2022-to-2031/>

> The WHO reported over 6.3 million deaths from COVID-19 as of early June 2022. The true death toll is likely much higher than official records, according to excess mortality figures. One model by The Economist estimates 21.2 million deaths due to COVID-19 as of late May 2022. Excess deaths are calculated by comparing the total deaths reported from all causes to how many deaths would be expected given data from recent years.
> 
> While COVID-19 will continue to impact humanity indefinitely, infectious disease experts are concerned that another pandemic could emerge at anytime.
> 
> There are a variety of factors that could might make a novel pandemic likely, including:
> 
> - The growth of the world population.
- The continuation of factory farming.
-  Climate change increasing cross-species viral transmission risk.
-  Habitat destruction exposing people to new pathogens.
- It becoming increasingly easy to manufacture deadly viruses in the lab.
> The U.S. congress thus far failing to pass pandemic prevention legislation.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the likelihood of a novel pandemic occurring in the coming decade.
> 
> ___Will there be a novel pathogen that kills over 25 million people between 2022 and 2031 (inclusive)?___
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if at least 25 million people have died from an infectious pathogen (excluding SARS-CoV-2 and its descendants) from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2031, according to excess mortality figures compiled by what Metaculus judges to be the most credible of following sources:
> 
> - The World Health Organisation (or its successor)
- Credible media reports/models
- Academic studies/models
> 
> If there are several reports/models judged credible by Metaculus admins, the resolution will be determined by the median of the reported deaths.
> 
> Descendants of SARS-CoV-2 will not be included for purposes of this question, even if there are new variants that differ substantially from existing circulating variants. New variants of other existing pathogens that have caused pandemics, for instance HIV and TB, would also not count. However, a new strain of influenza that causes a pandemic would count.

<iframe src="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/embed/11164/" width="100%" height="300"></iframe>

Let $A$ denote the event that there is a novel pandemic that kills 25m people in the interval [2022, 2031]. 

My immediate attitude is that the chance of this event 

### High-risk Labatory Incidents 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11273/number-of-bio-lab-incidents-from-2022-2026/>

> There is an extensive history of laboratory biosecurity incidents, including at high-security laboratories. One paper by Manheim and Lewis (2021) found 71 incidents involving "either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent" between 1975 and 2016 (inclusive).
> 
> There are four biosafety levels, each with specific controls for containment of microbes and biological agents based on the nature of the microbes/agents being worked on. The US Department of Health and Human Services describes these four levels:
> 
> > - BSL-1: used to study infectious agents or toxins not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adults.
- BSL-2: used to study moderate-risk infectious agents or toxins that pose a risk if accidentally inhaled, swallowed, or exposed to the skin.
- BSL-3: used to study infectious agents or toxins that may be transmitted through the air and cause potentially lethal infection through inhalation exposure.
- BSL-4: used to study infectious agents or toxins that pose a high risk of aerosol-transmitted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease for which no vaccine or therapy is available.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the risks in laboratory biology work over the coming years, which is important given its potential as a pandemic threat.
> 
> ___How many high-risk laboratory biosecurity incidents will occur between 2022 and 2026 (inclusive)?___
> 
> This question will resolve as the best estimate of the number of human-caused pathogen exposure events at laboratories between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2026, according to information available by January 1, 2032. If no such estimate is available at that time, Metaculus Admins will attempt to make such an estimate by counting the number of such events.
> 
> For the purposes of this question, we will use the definition of "human-caused pathogen exposure events at laboratories" used by Manheim and Lewis (2019): "involving either accidental or purposeful exposure to, or infection by, a highly infectious pathogenic agent" and that the pathogenic agent is one that is "usable as a bioweapon, or that requires similar safeguards."

### US Commitment for Bioweapon Prevention 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11276/us-funds-new-programs-for-2022-bwc/>

> The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) is a biological weapons disarmament treaty that has been in effect since 1975. The BWC "effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons". As of February 2022, 184 states are party to the treaty.
> 
> There are BWC Review Conferences that take place every five years. According to the BWC text, these reviews function to "review the operation of the Convention" and to "take into account any new scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention." The next Review Conference, the Ninth Review Conference, is scheduled to be held November 28 to December 16, 2022.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand the potential for there to be newly funded BWC initiatives that result from the 2022 BWC Review Conference.
> 
> ___Will the US make any new commitment of over $1M for the prevention of biological weapons deployment at the 2022 BWC Review Conference?___
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if the United States makes any new commitment of funding (at a value of $1 million USD or more) at least one new program supporting a BWC initiative. If the US does not make any such public announcement between June 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023, this question will resolve as No.

### Review Process for BWC Review Conference 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11275/establishment-of-bwc-st-review-process/>

> The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) is a biological weapons disarmament treaty that has been in effect since 1975. The BWC "effectively prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons". As of February 2022, 184 states are party to the treaty.
> 
> There are BWC Review Conferences that take place every five years. According to the BWC text, these reviews function to "review the operation of the Convention" and to "take into account any new scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention." The next Review Conference, the Ninth Review Conference, is scheduled to be held November 28 to December 16, 2022.
> 
> In accordance with the need to "take into account any new scientific and technological developments relevant to the Convention," some BWC member states have proposed that there be established processes to systematically review developments in science and technology (S&T) under the convention. According to a UN study on the issue:

> > _To address changes in biology and biotechnology, BWC States Parties have established processes to review developments in science and technology, including annual expert meetings on this topic. However, shortcomings are evident in the current approaches and many BWC States Parties have expressed support for a more systematic review of science and technology under the Convention. This support is further reflected in the results of a voluntary UNIDIR survey of all BWC States Parties in which 39 of the 42 respondents indicated support for a mechanism to systematically review science and technology of relevance to the BWC._
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand whether processes to review developments in S&T will be agreed upon and will occur under the purview of the BWC, given political considerations and the fact that the decision would require unanimity.
> 
> ___Will a decision be made to start and fund a dedicated and systematic science and technology review process 2022 BWC Review Conference?___
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if a decision is made at the Ninth Review Conference to begin and fund a dedicated and systematic S&T review process. This review process can take any form and the funding can be of any amount for this to resolve positively.

### BARDA Mask Innovation Challenge Results

> Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11272/new-affordable-high-quality-mask-by-2025/>
> 
> The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted innovation in face masks, including through a US BARDA mask innovation challenge.
> 
> According to BARDA's target product profile, the main performance measures for its challenge are:
> - Thermal Burden & Moisture Retention
- Breathability
- Leakage Ratio
- Filter Efficiency
> 
> On June 6, 2022, BARDA announced the 10 finalists of the second phase of its mask innovation challenge. The final phase will result in two top winning designs and two runner-ups. BARDA plans on announcing these in October.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand whether the winning designs of BARDA's mask innovation challenge will be commercially available and affordable to the general public. This may inform the need for further mask innovation.
> 
> ___Will any of the winners of BARDA's mask innovation challenge be sold on Amazon and cost less than $1 (2021 USD) per unit before 2025?___
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if at least one of the four winning mask designs (the top two winners/two runner-ups) is commercially available and costs less than $1 per unit on or before December 31, 2024. If the mask is reusable — for the purposes of this question, meaning it is expected to last for at least 1 month of daily usage — then it can cost up to $25 per unit. All prices in the resolution of this question will be inflation-indexed to 2021 USD. The mask should be available for purchase on Amazon, since it dominates e-commerce.

### Portable Genomic Sequencing Devices

> Genomic sequencing is, among other things, important for identifying new pathogens and tracking the spread of already-known pathogens. However, the scale and ubiquity of genomic sequencing has in large part been limited by the cost and size of sequencers.
> 
> Currently, the most widely used handheld and portable genomic sequencing device is MinION by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. MinION uses a nanopore sequencing approach where DNA strands are passed through pores ("nanopores"), creating a shifting electrical signal that allows for identification of the nucleotide bases passing through. MinION has been commercially available since 2015 and as of June 2022, the starter pack (MinION Sequencing Device, Control Expansion, Flow Cell Wash Kit, Flow Cell, Sequencing Kit) costs $1,000.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand future progress toward more affordable handheld/portable sequencers, which may play an important role in identifying and tracking the spread of new pathogens.
> 
> ___When will there be a handheld and portable genomic sequencing device that costs <$250?___
> 
> This question will resolve on the date there is a handheld and portable genomic sequencing device that is commercially available and for which the starter kit costs less than $250 (inflation-adjusted to 2021 USD).
> 
> In addition to the sequencer itself, the starter kit should at include material for sample preparation — control expansion, the flow cell wash kit, flow cell, and sequencing kit. For this question, "commercially available" means that the device and accompanying starter kit material can be readily purchased online by anyone.
> 
> If this has not occurred by December 31, 2032, this question will resolve as > December 31, 2032.

### US Metagenomic Sequencing 

> Metagenomic sequencing is an approach that characterizes all of the genetic material (DNA and RNA) that is present in a sample. Recent developments in metagenomics, namely the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, have enabled billions of base pair reads in a single run — allowing for a relatively fast and inexpensive analysis of all the genetic content of a sample. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is different from most other approaches in that it can be untargeted as opposed to involving the targeting of specific pathogens.
> 
> As additional context, the following is a relevant description about mNGS by the American Society for Microbiology:
> 
> > _Metagenomic NGS (mNGS) is simply running all nucleic acids in a sample, which may contain mixed populations of microorganisms, and assigning these to their reference genomes to understand which microbes are present and in what proportions. The ability to sequence and identify nucleic acids from multiple different taxa for metagenomic analysis makes this a powerful new platform that can simultaneously identify genetic material from entirely different kingdoms of organisms._
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand whether untargeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing will be utilized on a large scale in the US for pathogen identification.
> 
> ___Will the U.S. CDC sponsor or support a nationwide metagenomic sequencing program before 2025?___
> 
> This question will resolve as Yes if the US CDC is either sponsoring or supporting a nationwide metagenomic sequencing program that has at least 50 total sites in at least 10 different counties at any time before December 31, 2024, according to credible media reports. At least one of the goals of such a program should be identification of novel pathogens. The program must be active on or before December 31, 2024, meaning that at least 50 sites across at least 10 counties are actively doing metagenomic sequencing on envrionmental samples or random clinical samples.
> 
> As an example of what form such a nationwide metagenomic sequencing program might take, consider the CDC's ongoing COVID wastewater surveillance program. This COVID-specific program involves state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments submitting testing data to CDC, and CDC then standardizing and interpreting the data. As of June 5, 2022, there are 748 sites with "current data," and hundreds of US counties are represented.

### New SARS-CoV-2 Variant 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11269/date-new-variant-overtakes-omicron/>

> Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple novel variants have emerged as a result of continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Of particular importance have been variants of concern (VOCs), which according to WHO are assessed to have at least one of the following:
> - Increase in transmissibility
- Increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation
- Decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics.
> 
> The two currently circulating variants of concern are Delta and Omicron, with Omicron having been dominant globally (>50% prevalence of sequences) since the week of January 03-09 2022 according to GISAID. Before Omicron, Delta had overtaken all other variants to become dominant globally.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to inform whether and how vaccine formulations should be updated so that they are tailored to be variant-specific. Moreover, there is a need to understand the potential for a new wave of the pandemic driven by a novel variant.
> 
> ___When will a SARS-CoV-2 variant overtake Omicron as the dominant variant globally?___
> 
> This question will resolve as the Sunday of the week that a SARS-CoV-2 variant other than Omicron makes up more than 50% of all sequences on the GISAID variant tracker.
> 
> Note that descendants of Omicron are considered to be Omicron subvariants rather than different variants. This includes Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which are ascendant globally as of early June 2022.
> 
> If no variant has overtaken Omicron to become dominant by December 31, 2024, this question will resolve as > December 31, 2024.

### SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Doses 

Find the question here: <https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11268/covid-vaccine-doses-cdcfda-approved-by-2025/>

> SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have been widely administered in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. The two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines used in the US are the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. As of June 5, 2022, the US has administered almost 570 million SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses, which constitutes about 97% of the 588.5 million total SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses administered.
> 
> As of June 2022, four doses (2 primary series, 2 booster doses) of each of the mRNA vaccines have been authorized by the US FDA and recommended by the US CDC for at least 15% of the US population.
> 
> The purpose of this question is to understand how frequently public health regulators and authorities will see the need to authorize/recommend additional SARS-CoV-2 mRNA doses over the next few years. This may indicate how valuable the development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine may be.
> 
> ___How many total SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses will the US FDA and CDC recommend for at least 15% of the US on December 31, 2024?___
> 
> This question will resolve as the greatest total number of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses that are FDA-authorized and CDC-recommended for at least 15% of the US population as of December 31, 2024. For example, if this question resolved as of June 1, 2022, the resolution would be 4.
> 
> Note that the 15% threshold for the percent of the US population would, for instance, probably include those who are 65 years of age and older given that about 16.5% of the US population is 65+ as of 2019.
