__Overview__: On 06/08/2022, I was invited to participate in Philip's Tetlock's Hybrid Forecasting-Persuasion Tournament. While I was not in the "core group of experts", I supposedly had enough "qualified background and experience" to participate, generally, and I looked forward to this event from the outside view. How difficult is it be for people to predict rares events ([global catastrophes][wiki_cata]) which, if they transpired, would be horrible for humanity? Recorded in this post are my thoughts, predictions, and reflections on the tournament as it occurred, posted $\geq 4$ months after the tournament was over.
