_A batch of forecasting questions I made on commercially cloning pets, along with the rationale for my forecasts on these questions._

According to the [Genetic Science Learning Center](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cloning/clonezone/), one timeline of research relevant to cloning is*:

- 1885 - First-ever demonstration of artificial embryo twinning
- 1902 - Artificial embryo twinning in a vertebrate
- 1928 - The cell nucleus controls embryonic development
- 1952 - First successful nuclear transfer
- 1958 - Nuclear transfer from a differentiated cell
- 1975 - First mammalian embryo created by nuclear transfer
- 1984 - First mammal created by nuclear transfer
- 1987 - Nuclear transfer from embryonic cell
- 1996 - Nuclear transfer from laboratory cells
- 1996 - Dolly: First mammal created by somatic cell nuclear transfer
- 1997 - First primate created by embryonic cell nuclear transfer
- 1997 - Nuclear transfer from genetically engineered laboratory cells
- 1998-1999 - More mammals cloned by somatic cell nuclear transfer
- 2001 - Endangered animals cloned by somatic cell nuclear transfer
- 2007 - Primate embryonic stem cells created by somatic cell nuclear transfer
- 2013 - Human embryonic stem cells created by somatic cell nuclear transfer

The abstract of the 2015 paper _[Artificial cloning of domestic animals](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/29/8874.full.pdf)_ summarizes the state of progress well:

> Domestic animals can be cloned using techniques such as embryo
splitting and nuclear transfer to produce genetically identical
individuals. Although embryo splitting is limited to the production
of only a few identical individuals, nuclear transfer of donor nuclei
into recipient oocytes, whose own nuclear DNA has been removed,
can result in large numbers of identical individuals. Moreover,
clones can be produced using donor cells from sterile animals, such
as steers and geldings, and, unlike their genetic source, these clones
are fertile. In reality, due to low efficiencies and the high costs of
cloning domestic species, only a limited number of identical in-
dividuals are generally produced, and these clones are primarily
used as breed stock. In addition to providing a means of rescuing
and propagating valuable genetics, somatic cell nuclear transfer
(SCNT) research has contributed knowledge that has led to the
direct reprogramming of cells (e.g., to induce pluripotent stem cells)
and a better understanding of epigenetic regulation during embry-
onic development.

In August 2005, researchers at the Seoul National University in South Korea produced the [first cloned dog](https://www.science.org/content/article/first-dog-cloned) that survived, and named it "Snuppy". There remains much work to be done before [cloning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_animal_cloning) becomes cheap enough to be commercially accessible to most people. Nevertheless, services are still available. In 2008, the cost of cloning a pet was [USD 100k](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/us/21dog.html). Currently, the company _[My Friend Again â€“ The Dog Cloning Company](https://myfriendagain.com/dog-cloning-cost/)_ charges USD 50k to clone a dog, and USD ~25k to clone a cat. The company [_Viagen_](https://www.viagenpets.com/product/initiate-cloning/) charges USD 50k for dogs as well, but charges USD 35k for cats, and USD 85k for horses.

***What will be the minimum price to clone a pet dog in 2030?***

This question resolves as the minimum commercially price (in inflation adjusted 2021 USD) available for cloning a pet dog in 2030.
