desc: "A collection of resources and updates on the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, including my personal takes and forecasts; I would call these takes \"artless\", as my interest in this conflict has been driven by recent events (which means that I am still rapidly trying to catch up on the history) and my perspectives lack important cultural context (I've never been to Ukraine, have never spoken to a sample of Ukrainians, and have no connections to the politicians involved; my takes on the subject are only informed by what I've read or seen on the Internet)"

## Motivation
_Concise thoughts on people's interests in this conflict, on forecasting it, on my feelings towards it, and on my existing knowledge of geopolitics._

As with most other people I personally know and have seen on Twitter, Reddit, Metaculus, Discord, LessWrong, etc..., I have become very interested in understanding the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, and am watching closely to see what is transpiring and am trying to predict what will eventually come to pass. Across all discussions of this unfolding event, there is the concrete sense that it is something very important for the future; the landscape of international relations and diplomacy, of global economics, of Russia's economy and power, and of conflict resolution and instigation, among other things, seems to be rapidly changing.

&emsp; What people one day may come to realize were the true consequences of the Russo-Ukrainian War of 2022 will likely differ from what we currently expect the consequences to be. Nevertheless, I believe forecasting the outcomes of this conflict is a valid pursuit, and if done properly and honestly, can inform both policy and individual decision making, among other things. The [wisdom of the crowd][wiki_wis] can many times outperform experts; I would like to contribute to this wisdom on Metaculus, but I would also generally like for my forecasts to be accurate. If I were a Ukrainian living in Kyiv in January or early February 2022, I would likely have benefitted tremendously from being able to forecast the war. As a United States and global citizen, being able to forecast conflict, natural or economic disaster, nuclear risk, and other similar things will quite certainly be something useful.

&emsp; This conflict has engendered many strong feelings and many pressing thoughts. I have empathy for the Ukrainians; there have been many times recently (usually when I've felt cold or hungry) where I've thought about what it must be like to be someone my age in Ukraine who is currently starving, sleep-deprived, injured, frightened, etc... I hope for de-escalation and I hope for Putin's assassination or return to mental-clarity - I hope generally for peace. When Putin changed the nuclear alert level from "constant" (Level 1/4) to "elevated" (Level 2/4), I felt a wave of nervousness, as I increased the likelihood in my mind that a non-test nuclear weapon will be deployed soon. Should such an event occur, I believe there would be [third world war][wiki_w3]. Fortunately for my well-being, I presently believe it's very likely that a conflict of this magnitude won't occur in next 25 years. If I am wrong, then at least I will have spared myself the emotional drain from having spent time dwelling on the belief that there was going to be such a conflict.

&emsp; My geopolitical knowledge is quite sparse. I am not an expert in international relations, warfare, etc... Despite this, I believe my exposure through the Internet to expert opinions, to the voices and opinions of those directly affected by the conflict, and to primary sources such as satellite imagery and combat footage is sufficient to make forecasts on the subject, and to discuss it in an epistemically rigorous fashion. It could be the case that developments in the conflict are highly a function of ideas generated by Russian or Ukrainian cultures and histories, which are subjects that I know little about and can _experience_ very little of in my present position, but I think this is likely not the case, as there is a track record of Russian invasions of other countries and as the logistics of warfare are not governed completely by Russian and Ukrainian ways of being. There is also the point to be made that many expert opinions and reports capture a reasonable amount of this culture and history, as in many cases they have been monitoring tension between Russian and Ukraine for many years.
