__Disclaimer__: I want to improve the long-term future, and believe that these courses on global priorities and longtermism will help me with this. Below are the notes I've taken / am taking on many essays concerning longtermism and global priorities. I try to red-team, ask new questions, and distill as much as I can; my effectiveness with these things needs some improvement, but at a minimum, you and my future self might find some of this commentary useful. Given that these courses all cover longtermism, global priorities, and existential risk, there is some overlap - I cover the essays in the order they're listed, and don't include repeats, so this notes page is not fully representative of courses (save for the first one) in isolation.

### The Case for Longtermism

- Author: Hilary Greaves and William MacAskill
- Written: June 2021
- Extent: ? 
- Durability: ?

___Notes, Quotes, Questions, Critiques, and Comments___

- How many years of human history are left?: 
  - _"...we still have over 200,000 years to go (Barnosky et al. 2011); there could be a further one billion years until the Earth is no longer habitable for humans (Wolf and Toon 2015); and trillions of years until the last conventional star formations (Adams and Laughlin 1999:34)."_
- __Longtermism__: _"...we should be particularly concerned with ensuring that the far future goes well"_
- __Strong Longtermism__: _"the view that impact on the far future is the most important feature of our actions today"_
- How many years in the future should "long-term" refer to? 
- __Axiological Strong Longtermism__: _"in the most important decision situations facing agents today, (i) every option that is near-best overall is near-best for the far future, and (ii) every option that is near-best overall delivers much larger benefits in the far future than in the near future."_
- If society actually adopted axiological strong longtermism, what would change?
  - _"We believe that strong longtermism is of the utmost importance: that if society came to adopt the views we defend in this paper, much of what we prioritise in the world today would change."_
- What is consequentialism and what is invoked when it is assumed? 
  - _"First, since we do not assume consequentialism, we must distinguish between axiological and deontic claims."_
