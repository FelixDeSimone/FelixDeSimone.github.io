__Epistemic Status__: This page is meant as a place for me to explore my preliminary considerations for bettering the long-term future. As such, many ideas are incomplete, inadequate, half-unthought, or wrong. I am simply trying to learn more about what measures I should take in my life to impact the future positively. Recommendations are welcome.
