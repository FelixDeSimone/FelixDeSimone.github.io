It whirls around its host with both elegance and rapidity, completing one orbit every eleven Earth-days. It is a domain of scorching heat and unbearable cold. Yet nestled between these extremes lies a glorious sliver sculpted by nature and time, a world unto itself, filled with endless forms of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in this world within a world, Xen was afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had not the time to admire his surroundings, as calming and serene as they would otherwise appear. The dull maroon land around him was peppered with clumps of green-blue grass. Each strand stood tall and firm, in utter defiance of the ferocious wind which ebbed and flowed in thick and soupy waves. In the distance towered a few menacing and jagged mountains, their snow-capped tips barely visible through the dense atmospheric haze. The mother star stood motionless, perched just above the tallest peak, nearly scraping the horizon. In the past, Xen would always stop to bask in its glow. But now, he rushed through it all. The broadened bases of his three sturdy legs pushed against the ground as quickly as they could, propelling his narrow and cylindrical body towards the station now at the edge of his sight. His wide eye swiveled on its stalk to avoid the wind and blinked several times for good measure. He tried in vain to ignore the catastrophe at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what seemed only to be an instant, he boarded his transport pod, which began racing along its familiar track. The mother star dipped below the horizon, and the last embers of natural light faded from view. Soon, new and artificial lights appeared in the distance, in one imposing cluster after another. &lt;em&gt;So many habitats, he thought. No wonder we are in such a predicament.&lt;/em&gt; Though his capsule was highly insulative, he felt the chill of his new surroundings trickle through. There was no warmth around him now, no mother star, no life. Just a cold eternal night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transport pod veered away from the larger luminous aggregations, heading instead towards a remoter site. An unknown increment of time passed by. The pod decelerated, so smoothly that Xen hardly noticed. And there stood the Observatory, stretching out in curved metallic majesty before his eye. The pod crept through a rectangular opening which seemed microscopic against the building’s scale. Xen promptly exited his vehicle and locomoted toward his post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All around him were dozens of his fellow luminaries, each one an expert in some astronomical field, each one renowned across the planet for their work, each one hammered without mercy by the stress and fatigue of the present crisis. Some stood still, scrutinizing data that might deliver salvation. Others paced tripedally back and forth, in the throes of intense thought. Still others traveled along the spiraling steps hugging the Observatory’s circumference, seeking to readjust the telescope which sat perched atop the dome. The hum of intellectual activity filled the air. Such a gathering of minds had never before been seen; and yet, none knew whether it would be enough. Their world sat trembling in the throes of calamity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Edoi&lt;/em&gt;, reasoned Xen, &lt;em&gt;are the victims of our own success. I remember when our population was just 50 million. What a time that was. We spread out in comfort along that narrow band, that precious zone of water and life straddling the edges of inhospitability. We did not recognize the precarious nature of our world. We merely took from it. Now our numbers have doubled, but that wispy habitable domain has remained just as narrow as it ever was. And if we fail in our next task, our folly will be our end…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xen brought himself out of this pessimistic monologue. He could not allow for despair. Although the chances of locating another world to support the surplus population were slim, they were not zero. Although the sliver of hope remaining in his mind was as narrow as the sliver of life on his planet, it was there nonetheless, and it would not be extinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He arrived at his post. His attention turned to the monitor before his eye. Directly below it sat a tightly compact sphere, etched with dozens of symbols, glowing a faint and delicate green. Without hesitation, he deftly extended his sole appendage from the center of his body and maneuvered its tip over the surface of this miraculous device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monitor lit up several lines in a bleakish blue. Xen scrutinized
their contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;ORBITAL PERIODS UNTIL FOOD SUPPLY DEPLETION: 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INDIVIDUALS AT RISK OF FAMINE: 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CARRYING CAPACITY OF STARSHIP: 5.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STELLAR SYSTEMS SURVEYED: 942&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HABITABLE PLANETS DETECTED: 0
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This did not bode well. The Observatory, and its accompanying space telescope, had been operating for one hundred orbital periods. Yet the fate of the Edoi depended on the next two. Xen opted wisely to ignore his training in statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pressed a few more markings on the glowing sphere. &lt;em&gt;Have my results come in yet?&lt;/em&gt; he wondered. The screen quickly revealed that they had not. He stamped his front limb in annoyance; the resulting sonic shock would have startled his two back legs, had they only been granted the gift of perception. For the time being, when his fellow scientists busied themselves in their tasks, he had to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This interval of patience would not be nearly so irritating if he only had more at which to fix his gaze. He adored the wonders of his world. They had always provided him limitless enchantment. The most joyous sections of his life were spent in quiet solitude; immersed in forests of parabolic trees and fields of flowing turquoise grass; observing the purple herds of timid Neyqhim, their two stocky legs jutting sideways from their rounded heads, who rotated every time they took a step; admiring the sluggish Frantons twice his size, their ovular bodies slithering on the ground and their antennae reaching up past his own eyestalk; squinting to locate the canopy-dwelling Ourtans, who filled their pouches with air and floated with grace from one tree to another. Even the rivers seemed to sing to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But alas, he could not now gaze upon a single living thing save his own species, for the Observatory stood outside the narrow domain of life. It had to be so. It was here, on the side of darkness, eternally opposite the mother star, that the greatest astronomical work could occur. Even the nearest artificial habitats were a fair distance away. It often seemed as though all that really existed were Xen, his colleagues, the dome surrounding them, and the lifeless expanse beyond. And that was as it should be. A miniscule price to pay for the greatest science of the planet. A still-smaller price for the salvation of the Edoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without nature’s majesty there to embrace him, Xen observed his colleagues. The bustle of scientific life was all around, infused with a degree of circumstantial panic. His gaze caught Ekala, the foremost expert in spectroscopy, scrutinizing an atmospheric graph and hanging her eyestalk in dismay at the lack of oxygen. His attention moved to Mondil, a pioneer of density surveys, explaining to an inquiring colleague why one world under scrutiny had recently been proven gaseous. His scrutiny swiveled to Nuloke, an imposing figure in transit research, who had just found another planet to be too distant from its star to allow for liquid water. And amid all this activity, Xen was still awaiting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was not overly optimistic. The system in question had four known gaseous worlds, directly imaged around a humdrum star. It had at first been passed over without much thought, until closer analysis had revealed orbital timing anomalies of unknown origin. Some suggested other planets. But these deviations were so miniscule that Xen thought it likelier to be mere statistical noise. At any rate, he wished to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Xen waited, he could not help noting sardonically to himself the state of things. &lt;em&gt;How curious&lt;/em&gt;, he thought, &lt;em&gt;that we have succeeded where we expected failure and failed where we expected success. Even a few hundred orbits ago, I had dismissed the notion that a craft could touch the stars. Let alone a craft of this scale! Fifty million individuals travelling at half the speed of light? Preposterous. And yet, the starship awaits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When this Observatory was new&lt;/em&gt;, continued his mind on its bemused course, &lt;em&gt;I was sure we would uncover habitable worlds in hardly any time at all. I thought they would be everywhere in our data, more common than One-Winged Gliders by a muggy pond. And now, nine hundred and forty-two stars later, it seems that I was wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What an interesting turn of events. The impossible waits patiently for the easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flash of light interrupted Xen’s wandering brain. He returned his attention to the monitor. Plastered across it was the message for which he had been waiting. &lt;em&gt;NEW DATA FROM STAR S-943_G, 138.4 LIGHT-ORBITAL PERIODS DISTANT&lt;/em&gt;, it declared. The stress and trepidation which he had theretofore managed to keep at bay overtook in an instant his more stoic attributes and rattled him from the base of his legs to the tip of his eyestalk. He could not bear this suspense. The bumps and folds of his appendage seamlessly pressed that glowing-green sphere in precise asynchronous order, and waves of information burst forth from the screen like gamma rays from a supernova. He shuffled half a step closer. He leaned forward. He entered a mode of intense and unrelenting scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before him was a graph displaying the light output of the star in question. And in the center of the graph lay a dip. A tiny, unassuming, barely visible dip. His eye widened in shock. &lt;em&gt;Could it be?&lt;/em&gt; His statistical mind remained skeptical. &lt;em&gt;Small enough to be an error&lt;/em&gt;. He switched to the data from the space telescope, untampered by deceiving atmospheric haze. They showed the same results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was no error. This was a new world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xen needed to learn more as quickly as he could. He plunged into a flurry of calculations. He wrested with haste his cardinal answer from the depths of ambiguity. &lt;em&gt;This planet&lt;/em&gt;, he exclaimed internally, &lt;em&gt;is smaller than our own!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light curve in front of him was only the beginning. The two magnificent telescopes, one so proximate and one so far away, had produced such a bounty of data, in such diverse and imposing categories, that he knew he could not possibly examine it all. He required more answers, from minds more knowledgeable than his own. And he intended to procure them as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His appendage’s tip glid restlessly over the sphere. The figures on his screen changed with a rapidity demanding every drop of his conscious attention. He sent his treasure trove of data to one luminary after another, to experts on planetary orbits, on planetary mass, on planetary composition, on planetary atmospheres, scattered throughout the Observatory and yet all working thenceforth as one mind. A palpable excitement filled the air. The astronomers, in unison, quickened their pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this fateful flurry of discovery continued without pause or abatement, the collective scientific being of the Observatory, each living component so engrossed as to forget the existence of the external, uncovered one tantalizing increment of information after another. And each step in this endeavor brought its undertakers closer to triumphant hope. This strange new planet was revealed to be rocky in character. Its distance from its star was found to permit liquid water on its surface. But this was not yet sufficient. The tension mounted. Every eye stood unblinkingly fixed on one final variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope and anxiety, when combined, constitute a supremely potent force. Nowhere in the galaxy has this been more fully demonstrated than on this world, in this Observatory, in the moments preceding the greatest revelation in the history of the Edoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A voice pierced through the suspense. Ekala, master of spectroscopy, clutching translucent sheets of atmospheric data, filled her throat sack with air and exclaimed her findings for all to hear. “Nitrogen- dominated atmosphere”, she began, making no attempt to suppress her delightedness—the space fell utterly silent in anticipation, and her words crept up to a deafening fortissimo—“containing oxygen and water vapor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting reaction touched the limits of transcendence. Innumerable cries of joy and relief cascaded throughout the Observatory, rushed up its spiraled steps, careened against its instruments, shook its very foundations. The wrenching fear and omnipresent dread which had for so long infected the deepest recesses of every psyche were banished in an instant, conquered by an overpowering and effervescent hope. Though the astronomers stood on the shadowed side of their lonely world, they felt nonetheless the glorious light of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sorrows of the species were behind them at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarter of an orbital period had passed, and Xen shuffled along in line. All that separated him from the starship were the masses to his front, waiting in hushed patience to board. No matter how long he stared at the craft, his awe and disbelief at its scale refused to fade. Its silvery pyramidic body sloped upward to some indeterminate point concealed by the clouds. A thousand rows of innumerable individuals streamed all around him, each one reaching an entry point along the perimeter of its base. He was in awe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, transfixed by the starship though he may have been, Xen’s attention turned to the world he would soon abandon. The mother star rested, as always, near the horizon, the sharpness of its outline curtailed by atmospheric scatter. Nearby, a lone yet sturdy tree stood proudly anchored in the rusted soil. High above him, a pair of Ourtans floated along in dark blue splendor, chattering to one another in sparkling tones, their spherical air-filled pouches keeping them adrift. He could hardly believe he had chosen to desert such beauty. He could have remained behind with one half of the race, while the other half continued on their interstellar odyssey. But this, he knew, would betray his scientific mind. To land upon a new world, its secrets awaiting revelation, was too much to resist. The joys of familiarity, however great, equaled not the joys of discovery. And so he remained in line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He soon arrived at the starship’s base. A parabolic archway awaited his approach. He stepped through. He was met with very little open area, very little empty space, just a series of walls and corridors. But he had not long to observe this setting. The floor beneath his feet, in a state of constant motion, swiftly carried him and his fellow voyagers along a steep incline, up past the fuel-filled foundation and towards ever-greater heights. All the while, Xen could discern nothing. The secrets of the ship lay beyond a perpetual wall. He suspected that the bulk of this hidden interior supported a crisscrossing network of moving platforms. He wondered when he would reach his hibernation chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An instant after this thought materialized, the platform stopped abruptly. &lt;em&gt;Every&lt;/em&gt; platform stopped abruptly. The starship was full. The walls retracted. And in their place stood row upon endless row of stasis pods, so simple and elegant as to belie the complexity of their function. Xen peered at the capsule nearest him. Its glassy, transparent door revealed a sparse interior with only a single nozzle along its side. &lt;em&gt;That must be for the hibernation-inducing gas&lt;/em&gt;, he reasoned. He felt no trepidation. He knew that he would enter a deep slumber, his homeostatic functions would crawl to a stop, and half an eyeblink later, he would awake on the surface of another world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capsules opened, and fifty million fellow-creatures simultaneously stepped inside. Xen saw the door close completely in front of him, so tightly sealed that not even an asteroid impact could jolt it open. He felt a gentle puff of gas graze the back of his eyestalk. His vision began to fade. His mind began to settle. He drifted off into the boundary between existence and its opposite. His final sensation was a dull trembling beneath his feet as the starship left its world behind. His final thought was of fields of grass under a red-tinted sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had begun his voyage to the planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Felix DeSimone</name></author><summary type="html">Proxima Centauri b is a curious planet, graced by the calming reddish tones of its diminutive star.
